            <p>My name is Tyler Byrne and this upcoming summer of 2023 I will be graduating from Michigan State University with a bachelor's degree in information science! I am beyond excited to get my career and the next chapter of my life started and I hope this website can showcase my skills and ambitions in an effective way. </p>
            <p>Upon graduation I hope to make my way into the vast cybersecurity field. My goal is to find an entry level position as a security analyst. Either an information security analyst or network security analyst would be ideal for but, I understand that those entry level positions are hard to find. So, just any entry level cybersecurity position would be great and very beneficial to help me gain some experience in the field. Even if I would have to join a company in an IT position and shadow someone on the cybersecurity team, eventually making my way onto that team after learning the basics would be fantastic. To help me gain knowledge in the field I intend to attend Michigan States graduate cybersecurity program. This program is well known and acknowledged and really gives graduates an edge. I also plan on obtaining the security plus certification from COMPTIA in hopes that it will help me get that entry level position I dream of. </p>
            <p>During my time at Michigan State I have done numerous things that have helped me gain tons of useful knowledge in the information, technology, and security field. Starting off with the classes I have taken and plan to take in my final semesters. </p>

            <h2>Relevant Projects</h2>
            <p>Besides the many great classes I have taken at Michigan State, I have also produced many useful projects that help showcase my knowledge with technology and web development. Below are some examples of these projects.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project-info">
            <article class="project-info-2">
                <p>Starting off with Android app development. Me and an engineering team created a Michigan State themed trivia app able to run on BlueStacks and the android Play Store. My team designed the app using the MIT app developer software. This helped me develop kep knowledge in creating and combining functions to create a smooth process. Also, analyze user data to optimize functionality and improve the user experience. We also elevated the app by researching similar apps to identify app features and benefits that resulted in high user satisfaction and rates.</p>
            </article>
            <article class="project-info-2">
                <p>Another project was the Arduino/Adafruit gemma LED circuit design. For this project I worked in another team environment to design and build a circuit to light multi-colored LEDs in a specific pattern. During this project I learned how to use and manipulate code in Arduino IDE to address required output specifications.  We also learned how to solder delicate wires. This project helped me build important communication and team skills while in an engineering environment.</p>

            <article class="project-info-2">
                <p>Lastly, I want to talk about my experience in MI 349. During the duration of this class I completed numerous projects that involved utilizing HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make successful websites. Some of those websites include a JavaScript soundboard, a personal blog website, and this website you are currently on right now! During this class I learned so many useful skills about web design that I believe I would be able to implement in my future career. At the bottom of this webpage will be a link to my GitHub account containing all these projects.</p>

            <h2>Relevant Experience</h2>
            <p>Over the last summer of 2022 I was lucky enough to have an amazing internship out in Troy Michigan with a company called Graham Healthcare Group. My position there was an IT support specialist. Over this internship I learned many valuable skills that helped me get my foot in the tech world door. To start I was responsible for backing up old equipment using commands sent from a software called Kaseya then re-imaging the laptops using a cloud-based SanDisk USB drive coded by PowerShell. This equipment included laptops, cellphones, and tablets. I also assisted the asset manager with sending out equipment, sending out termination tickets to employees, receiving equipment and wiping it/prepping it to be ready to deploy again. Also helped maintain track of inventory. A technical skill I learned was being able to assess internal laptop issues involving hardware and software by running diagnostic tests and, if there was a hardware issue such as a battery problem, I learned how to open the laptop and reseed the battery. During my time I was also responsible for making sure new hires had the correct equipment for their position, setting that equipment up with all the right applications on software. Another skill I learned was customer relations, whenever there was a technical problem in the building I had to go and help them . We also had people walking into our office at any time with issues that we would assess on the spot. Lastly there was a company wide project called the S9 legacy project that me and the other intern were tasked with. This project included a little over 800 employees  that had galaxy S9 phones. We had to coordinate with the employees that had these S9â€™s and get them the new company issued S20. This involved having them come to the office for a swap or, shipping it to them and setting it up remotely. </p>
