            <p>My name is Tyler Byrne and this upcoming summer of 2023 I will be graduating from Michigan State University with a bachelor's degree in information science! I am beyond excited to get my career and the next chapter of my life started and I hope this website can showcase my skills and ambitions in an effective way. </p>
            <p>Upon graduation I hope to make my way into the vast cybersecurity field. My goal is to find an entry level position as a security analyst. Either an information security analyst or network security analyst would be ideal for but, I understand that those entry level positions are hard to find. So, just any entry level cybersecurity position would be great and very beneficial to help me gain some experience in the field. Even if I would have to join a company in an IT position and shadow someone on the cybersecurity team, eventually making my way onto that team after learning the basics would be fantastic. To help me gain knowledge in the field I intend to attend Michigan States graduate cybersecurity program. This program is well known and acknowledged and really gives graduates an edge. I also plan on obtaining the security plus certification from COMPTIA in hopes that it will help me get that entry level position I dream of. </p>
            <p>During my time at Michigan State I have done numerous things that have helped me gain tons of useful knowledge in the information, technology, and security field. Starting off with the classes I have taken and plan to take in my final semesters. </p>
